# stable_diffusion-pytorch
This is an implementation for [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/news/stable-diffusion-public-release) model in PyTorch.The code has been written in Python, so make the necessary changes to the scripts to run them.
Thanks to [Umar Jamilai](https://www.youtube.com/@umarjamilai) and his videos on the topic, they were extremely helpful and valuable.

More comments will be added in the future to make the process of understanding the code easier.
